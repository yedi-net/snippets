# Yedi Network Snippets Playground

Welcome to the Yedi Network Snippets Playground repository! This repository serves as a collection of folders, each containing code snippets, demos, or prototypes related to cryptography. Feel free to explore, contribute, and propose your own playground or demo by adding a folder to the repository.

## Guidelines for Contributions

To propose your own playground or demo, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click on the "Fork" button on the top right corner of this repository's page to create your own copy of the repository.

2. **Make Changes**: Add your code snippet, demo, or prototype to a new folder within the repository. You can organize your folder as you like, but ensure it's related to cryptography.

3. **Query for a Pull Request**: Once you've made your changes, submit a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository. Be sure to provide a clear description of your proposed addition.

## Contribution Guidelines

- There are no strict limitations on the type of content you can contribute. Anything related to cryptography is welcome.
- Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Feel free to enhance or modify existing playgrounds and demos if you see room for improvement.

## Metadata Storage

We are currently exploring ways to store metadata per folder. This metadata would provide additional information about each playground or demo, such as tags or descriptions. If you have suggestions on how to implement this, please feel free to contribute your ideas.

## Accessing the Data

The data in this repository is hosted on GitHub, following the folder structure described above. The Yedi Network website reads the content of the repository via the GitHub API and renders it accordingly.
